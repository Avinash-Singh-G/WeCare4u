# INTRODUCTION:-


Periods usually arrive every month in a woman’s life. But we all are so busy in our mundane work that we tend to forget our period dates. Moreover, most of the women have such an inconsistent cycle that it is worthless for them to remember their previous dates. Also due to lack of awareness and hesitation in the society many women don’t know the reason and what exactly one should do during menstruation.


# PROBLEM SOLUTION:-


To solve this problem faced by almost every woman we made a period tracking webapp. 
This will help in recording the changes in her cycle which might be the sign of a potentially dangerous health issue. Furthermore, it will also help her to know more about her body, mood swings and to avoid sudden and severe period cramps. We also provide the estimated day of ovulation so that a woman could know when we can conceive. 


# NOVELTY:-


Most of the pre-existing websites or apps lack accuracy so women generally get more confused about their dates and moreover these apps take into account very few features to determine the dates. We take more data into account to provide much more accurate and efficient results. Our other features include specialized **WeCare forums** where women can freely and anonymously discuss their queries. We also have our 24x7 **WeCare chatbot** where women can get answers to their queries anytime.


# Flask

cd Flask
pip install -r requirements
python  flaskapp.py

The above command will expose the local port 5000 and the project can be viewed from there. <br>
The Flask is also used to provide routing solutions for the app. This includes a home page, by the name of index.html, rendered at / route using Flask.
